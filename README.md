# Project-Part-1

In this project, we added a GUI to Lab 1 which allowed us to order different quantities of cookies, sandwiches, and waters.
As per the feedback from our project progress meeting, users can input different quantities to order instead of selecting one food at a time.
Users can place multiple orders in one session.
This calculates subtotal, 7% sales tax, and grand total of your order.

This project was completed by Ava Steele and Ethan Funke.
